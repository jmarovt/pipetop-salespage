	    		<h2>About the customer</h2>
	    		<p>Our customer is a few years old e-commerce recommendation engine vendor. They started out as a small startup helping a handful of mid-level e-commerce businesses with on-site personalised product recommendations. In the past year they’ve hit a few big milestones, proved their product value and business case. Subsequently they raised a substantial VC led A round.</p>

	    		<h2>Customer problem</h2>
				<p>After raising a big round of funding, our customer was presented with an expectation of quick new market expansion. Since they haven’t done foreign market expansion before, they faced a few unique challenges:</p>
	 
				<ul>
					<li>how to <strong>approach a new, unknown, market</strong>,</li>
					<li>how to <strong>estimate the potential market size</strong>,</li>
					<li>where to <strong>get the contact and contextual information about the companies</strong> in that market.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>On top of that, the customer started significantly ramping up the sales team, which presented them with a few additional challenges:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>how to <strong>generate a constant flow of quality leads</strong> to “feed” the bigger sales pipeline capacity,</li>
					<li>hot to <strong>equip new, unexperienced sales reps with a lot of contextual information</strong> about their prospects (so they don’t spend a lot of time doing sales research),</li>
					<li>how to <strong>estimate the number of needed new sales reps</strong> to match the new revenue milestones.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Pipetop solution</h2>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>we looked at the existing won and lost customer cases</strong> (from the initial market),</li>
					<li>in collaboration with our customer, <strong>we determined the most suitable market segment</strong>,</li>
					<li>we estimated the size of adjacent local markets and thus <strong>helped our customer hire the right amount of sales reps</strong>,</li>
					<li><strong>we started delivering fresh new leads for this market</strong> to their CRM as soon as the new hires were ready to start selling,</li>
					<li><strong>we equipped the sales team with enough contextual information</strong> that enabled our customer to get new sales reps up to speed quickly and start delivering above expected conversion results within 2 months.</li>
				</ul>


				<h2>Hard facts</h2>
				<ul class="highlight-section">
					<li>helped the client to successfully scale the sales team to 2 new markets (so far),</li>
					<li>improved the number of contacted leads/day by 13%,</li>
					<li>improved contact-to-demo conversion rates from initial market to new markets by 34%,</li>
					<li>improved the number of sold deals for an average sales person/month by 28%.</li>
				</ul>
