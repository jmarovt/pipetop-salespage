	    		<h2>About the customer</h2>
	    		<p>
	    			The customer is a small European 2 year old ESP (email service provider). It’s a young bootstrapped company built by 2 engineering co-founders. They have built the product and impressively grown it to more than 110 paying customers (through purely inbound sales).
	    		</p>

	    		<h2>Customer problem</h2>
				<p>
					Recently, the 2 founders figured out their ideal customer match - a small, but growing e-commerce company with less than 10 employees, that uses specific e-commerce technologies. The founders realised that almost all the leads that matched this criteria ended up converting into paying customers.
				</p>
	 
	 			<p>The market opportunity was clear:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>if they managed to attract more customers within their ideal market, they would be able to grow at a much higher rate.</strong></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Pipetop solution</h2>
				<p>
					This is a perfect problem for Pipetop to help with. Through consultations with the 2 founders we quickly realised that the best way forward would be to hire 2 additional sales professionals and work on an outbound sales strategy. All assisted by Pipetop’s sales intelligence platform, of course.
				</p>

				<p>Here are the steps we did:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>we mapped out the markets with the biggest opportunity for the mentioned customer</strong> by looking at the total number of customers within their previously observed ideal customer criteria (less than 10 employees, specific e-commerce technology platform),</li>
					<li>since they’ve hired 2 sales persons, we’ve <strong>equipped them with Pipetop’s e-commerce contextual data</strong> so they can focus on selling instead of researching,</li>
					<li>after they’ve outgrown some of the smaller European markets <strong>we’ve helped them to smoothly transition to new, bigger markets.</strong></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Hard facts</h2>
				<ul class="highlight-section">
					<li>managed to assist the customer with successful implementation of the outbound sales channel,</li>
					<li>helped increased their growth rate from 8% month-over-month to 19% month-over-month,</li>
					<li>by relying on Pipetop’s data, the customer can now accurately estimate how long it takes to penetrate specific markets,</li>
					<li>since using Pipetop’s intelligence platform, the customer has been able to target specific e-commerce businesses in 5 different local markets.</li>
				</ul>
