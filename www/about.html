    		<h2>Why we are building Pipetop</h2>

    		<div class="row">
	    		<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
	    		
		    		<p>Pipetop is a modern sales and marketing intelligence tool that helps vendors that sell to e-commerce businesses find relevant leads. Moreover, we equip them with contextual information that helps them significantly improve their sales efficiency.</p>

		    		<p>We love this problem because:</p>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li><strong>sales managers are under pressure:</strong> there is a lot of pressure on sales managers to make their outbound processes more efficient,</li>
		    			<li><strong>there is tons of unnecessary sales waste:</strong> sales teams spend enormous amount of time researching prospects and contacting wrong leads</li>
		    			<li><strong>traditional “lead list” providers suck:</strong> legacy “lead list” vendors offer outdated, badly categorized and mostly irrelevant data</li>
		    			<li><strong>web offers new ways of lead qualification:</strong> modern web-based signals (technology in use, website visitors, ad spend) give us much better contextual businesses information</li>
		    			<li><strong>sales teams deserve modern tools:</strong> sales teams have long been left in the darkness and haven’t seen big advances in their daily workflow</li>
		    		</ul>

	    		<p><strong>Young and fast growing market:</strong> E-commerce in it’s very narrow definition is still a very young, but fast growing market. That’s said, it’s currently capturing only <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ecommerce_sales_as_percent_retail_sales" target="_blank">6.4% of the whole US retail sales</a>, growing yearly at a double digit rate.</p>

				<h4>What fuels the e-commerce growth trend</h4>

				<p>Many traditional businesses are starting to supplement their traditional offline business models with online ones. On top of that, tons of young companies and individuals base their complete businesses on web sales. Consequently all these businesses need supporting technologies and services that make their day to day operations easier and allow them to stay focused on their core business areas. In turn this creates an ecosystem of companies that support e-commerce business.</p>

				<h4>Pipetop meets e-commerce</h4>

				<p>That’s where Pipetop comes into play. On the way to our <a href=“#about-vision”>long-term vision</a>, we needed to start with a small vertical. We chose e-commerce because it’s a fast growing sector, we have more than 10 years experience in this industry and e-commerce businesses, by their nature, expose a lot of contextual signals that can be extremely useful in the sales process.</p>

				<h4>Perfect option for every e-commerce vendor seeking scalable growth</h4>

				<p>If you are a vendor that serves e-commerce businesses and are looking for a way to pre-qualify your potential customers and sell globally with local intelligence, well, then Pipetop is a dream come true.</p>
