            <p>
              Traditional lead lists lack modern business categorisation and attributes. As a result, you end up wasting time doing extra research and double checking the provided information.

            <p>
              Google and Linkedin have become sales prospectors’ de-facto tools for researching potential leads. They are great, but unfortunately still take a lot of time from actual selling.
